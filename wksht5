PROBLEM SHEET 5
1. Write an ALP to convert a string in lower case letter to a string in UPPER CASE and
print it on the screen.
2. Write an 8086 ALP to compare two strings without using string instructions and display
appropriate messages.
3. Write an ALP to count the number of vowels in a given string.
4. Write an ALP to compare two strings that are stored in memory in different locations
and display the result of comparison in memory location 5200 as „Y‟ or „N.‟
5. Write a program in 8086 Assembly language to convert all upper case letters to lower
case and vice versa. Also the first character in each word should have the word count( in
number) prefixed.
For example ,the sentence “ this is MY FIRST ALP lab” shall be converted into “1.THIS
2. IS 3.my 4.first 5. alp 6. LAB”
6. Write a ALP that behaves like strcpy except it copies a maximum of n characters
(including the zero terminating byte). Pass the source string‟s address in es:di, the
destination string‟s address in dx:si, and the maximum length in cx.
7. .Write an ALP to parse a typical scanf statement in C language for eg.,…scanf(“%d
%d”, &a, &b) and validate the statement.
